# rev-u3d-dump - Unity IL2CPP Symbol Dumper

Use this skill when the task matches the description above.
Keep the initial response concise and only open bundled references or scripts when clearly needed.

## Quick cues

- Repo: `https://github.com/roytu/Il2CppDumper` (branch: `v39`)
- Supports metadata v24–v39
- Outputs `script.json` with function addresses — ready for IDA/Ghidra import
- Repo: `https://github.com/SamboyCoding/Cpp2IL`
- Supports metadata v39, but dummy DLLs lack `[Address]` attributes
- Useful for C# source reconstruction, not ideal for IDA import
- `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor` allows running on .NET 9/10 even though the project targets .NET 6/8
- Exit code 134 is normal in non-interactive mode (caused by `Console.ReadKey()` at the end)
