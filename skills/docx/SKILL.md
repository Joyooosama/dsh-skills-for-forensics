description: "Use this skill whenever the user wants to create, read, edit, or manipulate Word documents (.docx files). Triggers include: any mention of 'Word doc', 'word document', '.docx', or requests to produce professional documents with formatting like tables of contents, headings, page numbers, or letterheads. Also use when extracting or reorganizing content from .docx files, inserting or replacing images in documents, performing find-and-replace in Word files, working with tracked changes or comments, or converting content into a polished Word document. If the user asks for a 'report', 'memo', 'letter', 'template', or similar deliverable as a Word or .docx file, use this skill. Do NOT use for PDFs, spreadsheets, Google Docs, or general coding tasks unrelated to document generation."

# DOCX creation, editing, and analysis

Use this skill when the task matches the description above.
Keep the initial response concise and only open bundled references or scripts when clearly needed.

## Quick cues

- **Always use `WidthType.DXA`** — never `WidthType.PERCENTAGE` (incompatible with Google Docs)
- Table width must equal the sum of `columnWidths`
- Cell `width` must match corresponding `columnWidth`
- Cell `margins` are internal padding - they reduce content area, not add to cell width
- For full-width tables: use content width (page width minus left and right margins)
- **Set page size explicitly** - docx-js defaults to A4; use US Letter (12240 x 15840 DXA) for US documents
- **Never use `\n`** - use separate Paragraph elements
- **Never use unicode bullets** - use `LevelFormat.BULLET` with numbering config
