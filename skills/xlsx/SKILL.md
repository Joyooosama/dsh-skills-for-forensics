name: xlsx
description: "Use this skill any time a spreadsheet file is the primary input or output. This means any task where the user wants to: open, read, edit, or fix an existing .xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, or .tsv file (e.g., adding columns, computing formulas, formatting, charting, cleaning messy data); create a new spreadsheet from scratch or from other data sources; or convert between tabular file formats. Trigger especially when the user references a spreadsheet file by name or path — even casually (like \"the xlsx in my downloads\") — and wants something done to it or produced from it. Also trigger for cleaning or restructuring messy tabular data files (malformed rows, misplaced headers, junk data) into proper spreadsheets. The deliverable must be a spreadsheet file. Do NOT trigger when the primary deliverable is a Word document, HTML report, standalone Python script, database pipeline, or Google Sheets API integration, even if tabular data is involved."

# Requirements for Outputs

Use this skill when the task matches the description above.
Keep the initial response concise and only open bundled references or scripts when clearly needed.

## Quick cues

- Use a consistent, professional font (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman) for all deliverables unless otherwise instructed by the user
- Every Excel model MUST be delivered with ZERO formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?)
- Study and EXACTLY match existing format, style, and conventions when modifying files
- Never impose standardized formatting on files with established patterns
- Existing template conventions ALWAYS override these guidelines
- **Blue text (RGB: 0,0,255)**: Hardcoded inputs, and numbers users will change for scenarios
- **Black text (RGB: 0,0,0)**: ALL formulas and calculations
- **Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)**: Links pulling from other worksheets within same workbook
